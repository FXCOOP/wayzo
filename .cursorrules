# Wayzo HTML report rules
- Do NOT hide <img> elements with CSS (no `display:none` on images).
- Always render images as: placeholder DIV + <img> with loading="lazy" decoding="async" and explicit width/height.
- Use LOCAL image paths only: /docs/... (never remote CDNs) to ensure PDF/print works offline.
- Keep the reveal/fallback JS snippet at the end of <body>.
- Keep print CSS to avoid page-breaks inside images, tables, and headings.
- Safety facts for Santorini:
  * Red Beach: officially unsafe/closed beyond barriers — list as "viewpoint only", recommend Perissa/Perivolos for swimming.
  * Oia Castle: public viewpoint — do NOT label "Tickets".
  * Santo Wines: mention sunset slots fill fast, suggest booking ahead.
  * KTEL buses: pay conductor in cash, frequent summer service.
- Always include proper image placeholders with loading states.
- Use interactive checkboxes (☐/✅) for packing lists and budget items.
- Include proper error handling for failed images.
- Maintain print-friendly CSS for PDF generation.
